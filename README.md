# Please Note

The [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/privly/privly-library) is currently the focus of Privly's compiled library development due to its more robust support for sandboxing compiled code. To contribute to the compiled functionality, checkout the "nacl" branch of the Chrome library.

For more information on what Privly is, see https://priv.ly.

The development home of Privly is at http://www.privly.org/. For information on how to join the Privly community, read this: http://www.privly.org/content/welcome-privly-development
